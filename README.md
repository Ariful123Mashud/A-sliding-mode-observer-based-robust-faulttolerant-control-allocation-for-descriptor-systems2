# A-sliding-mode-observer-based-robust-faulttolerant-control-allocation-for-descriptor-systems2
The problem of designing an observer-based fault-tolerant control allocation mechanism for
a multi-input multi-output (MIMO) uncertain descriptor system (DS) subjected to actuator
faults/failures and external uncertainties is discussed in this paper. The proposed approach guarantees
system performance and closed-loop stability using the integral sliding mode control
(ISMC) and a fixed control allocation (CA) strategy. A robust sliding mode observer (SMO) is
designed to estimate the states of the DS in a realistic setting. The sliding surface is constructed
with the estimated states, following the ISMC principle. To meet the admissibility conditions of
DS, a multivariable super-twisting sliding mode control (STSMC) algorithm is designed. The CA
technique reallocates the control effort to the remaining healthy actuators on the occurrence
of any fault/failure. Lyapunov-based stability is established for the closed-loop system with the
controllerâ€“observer pair. Finally, the proposed design is validated by evaluating various actuator
fault/failure situations.
